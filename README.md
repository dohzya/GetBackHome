# Welcome on Get Back Home #

## Development tools ##

If you want to build the project from scratch, you will need the following tools:

- Git: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/)
- NPM: [https://npmjs.org/](https://npmjs.org/)

### Git ###

Sorry there, but I hope you already know a bit about Git and you have it on your computer. Just use it to clone the
project. For the rest of the README, the path where you have cloned it will be called [PROJECT].

### NPM ###

We will NPM to install Grunt and its plugins. Please, read the doc about how to install both Node.js and NPM:

- [https://github.com/isaacs/npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)
- [https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)

The moment you got an `npm` command in your shell, it's your win. Then run `npm install` to install all dependencies, this might take a while.

### Summary ###

If you have the tools installed, here is the standard procedure to start the project:

- Open a shell inside the project
- Run `gulp`, it will compile all resources and serve them with live-reloading
- Open a browser
- Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Enjoy developing while looking at your browser reloading your code by its own at each modification
